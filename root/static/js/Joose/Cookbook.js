Joose.Cookbook - How to cook a Joose

DESCRIPTION
===========

The Moose cookbook is a series of recipes showing various Joose features. 
Most recipes present some code demonstrating some feature, and then explain the details of the code.

You should probably read the [Joose.Manual][manual] first. The manual explains Joose concepts without being too code-heavy.


RECIPES
=======

Basic Joose
-----------


These recipes will give you a good overview of Joose's capabilities, starting with simple attribute declaration, 
and moving on to more powerful features like method modifiers, and more.

- [Joose.Cookbook.Basics.Recipe1][basics1] - The (always classic) **Point** example

A simple Joose-based class. Demonstrates Joose attributes and subclassing.
